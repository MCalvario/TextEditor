# TextEditor

## Description
As adeveloper I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Usage
To use the text editor web application, open the application in the editor. You should see a client server folder structure. When you run `npm run start` from the root directory, you will find that the application should start up the backend and serve the client. When you run the text editor application from your terminal, you will find that the JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack. When you run your webpack plugins, you will find that you have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file. When you use next-gen JavaScript in the application
you will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors. When you open the text editor, you will find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage. When you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, you will find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB. When you reopen the text editor after closing it, you will find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from the IndexedDB. Click on the Install button to download your web application as an icon on your desktop. When you load the web application, you should have a registered service worker using workbox. when you register a service worker, you should have your static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets. When you deploy to Render, you should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
